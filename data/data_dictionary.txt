Dictionary of Data Variables used in the COViz Project

The purpose of this dictionary is to enable the same 
visualization themes to be applied to data from different
sources. Each data theme will look for data variables with 
a given name. Thus, it should be easy to map data from a new 
data source if it uses the same variable names as an existing
data source.

VariableName	:	Description
---------------------------------------------------------
cases			:	The cumulative number of cases of COVID-19 recorded in a 
					district since the beginning of the epidemic.
tests			:	The cumulative number of COVID-19 tests run in a district
					since the beginning of the epidemic. Note that 
					some data sources report the number of tests, 
					while others report the number of people tested.
					Either way should allow for the same type of map theme,
					but the exact definition should be noted if possible.
					For now, we do not distinguish between these scenarios.
deaths			:	The cumulative number of people who have died of COVID-19
					in the district since the beginning of the epidemic.
